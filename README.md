# Stop russian terror

This project was created to help stop russian terror in Ukraine. 2022.02.24 russians started war in Ukraine. They started doing terror and killing civil peoples. We must do everything we can to stop them.

If you dont know a lot about situation in Ukraine you can watch this video - [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX4knBRYPV8). It`s recorded on russian language but have an english subtitles.

Use this project on your risk. Dont use it without agree from targets owners ;)

This scripts was created and tested on [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org) linux distribution. You can download it [here](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Download). Choose one with GUI because scripts are using xterm as target runner.

Also, you can try to run it on Debian 11 but it was not tested.
